# Developer guide

If you wanna make plugins for Enmity, you'll require `node` installed and you can use the [plugin-template](https://github.com/NotZoeyDev/Enmity-Plugins/tree/main/PluginTemplate) project as a starting point.

Plugins are installed over https, you can use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to quickly spin up a local web server to test out your plugins on your device.

For debugging, you can use `Console.app` on macOS connected to your device, search for `Discord` as the process and `javascript` for the category, make sure you enable `Include Info Messages`Â under the `Action` menu.

A proper cross-platform debugger will be available in a little bit, it'll allow for proper code testing, auto-completion for the Enmity api and much more.

Documentation for the API is available on [docs.enmity.app](https://docs.enmity.app).
